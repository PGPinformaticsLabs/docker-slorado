Slorado containerization
========================

[Slorado](https://github.com/BonsonW/slorado) is a basecaller built on top of
the S/BLOW5 format, a simplified lean version of [Dorado](https://github.com/nanoporetech/dorado).

This project aims to provide easy access to Slorado with reproducible builds on
AMD and nVidia GPU platforms, in the form of Docker containers that include
supporting libraries.

In addition, we will provide CWL tool description files that enables
integration of Slorado into bioinformatics pipelines.
